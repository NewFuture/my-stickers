### Storage and Usage of Data

My Stickers Extension allows you to save images and share to others.
And you can add sticker by two ways:

1. save images from the messages;
2. upload your own images as your stickers.

For the first way, **the URL of the image will be saved in our database**, but the image will not be stored.
Those stickers will keep the original authorization in teams (as shared SharePoint files).
Once, you delete this sticker, **all the data of this sticker in database will be deteted**.
You can save your private stickers in this way.

For the second way, **the uploaded images will save to our blob storage and public CDN** in order to speed up view experience.
You can share this sticker to others by sending it from this Extension.
The image will be available for anyone who has got the URL.
**When you delete the sticker you uploaded, only the URL will be deleted**, avoding to breaking others who already received your stickers.
In this way, **users will be solely responsible for the data shared**.

This extension will generate a short-term effective token for identity validation.
So that, you can only manage your own stickers in teams: list all your the stickers, edit the label of your sticker or delete a sticker.
Others are not accessible for those actions.

All of the stickers are stored for sending and view between users, and we do not use the data for any other purposes.
